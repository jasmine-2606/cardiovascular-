## 🧮 Risk Calculation Algorithm

The system uses a multi-factor risk assessment model that considers:

1. **Demographic Factors** (20% weight)
   - Age and gender
   - Family history

2. **Clinical Measurements** (40% weight)
   - Blood pressure (systolic/diastolic)
   - Cholesterol levels (HDL/LDL)
   - Blood glucose levels

3. **Lifestyle Factors** (25% weight)
   - Smoking status
   - Physical activity level
   - Diet quality

4. **Physical Metrics** (15% weight)
   - BMI calculation
   - Waist circumference

## 📈 Usage Examples

### Basic Risk Assessment
```typescript
const riskScore = calculateCardiovascularRisk({
  age: 45,
  gender: 'male',
  systolicBP: 140,
  cholesterol: 220,
  smokingStatus: 'former',
  diabetes: false
});
```

### Generating Reports
The system automatically generates comprehensive reports including:
- Risk percentage and category
- Personalized recommendations
- Lifestyle modification suggestions
- Follow-up timeline

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

- All patient data is processed locally
- No sensitive information is transmitted to external servers
- HIPAA compliance considerations implemented
- Secure data handling practices
